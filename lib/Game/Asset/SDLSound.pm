=head1 NAME

  Game::Asset::SDLSound - Load sound files out of Game::Asset files for playing in SDL

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $asset = Game::Asset->new({
        file => 't_data/test.zip',
    });
    my $sound = $asset->get_by_name( 'test_wav' );

    my $sdl = Game::Asset::SDLSound::Manager->new;
    $sdl->init;
    $sound->play;
    while( $sdl->is_playing ) { }
    $sdl->finish;


    # In your index.yml for the Game::Asset archive, add:
    flac: Game::Asset::SDLSound
    mp3: Game::Asset::SDLSound
    ogg: Game::Asset::SDLSound
    wav: Game::Asset::SDLSound

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Loads sound files from a L<Game::Asset> archive for playing in SDL. Support 
is provided for FLAC, OGG, MP3, and WAV files. Note that which of these can 
be played will depend on how your SDL_Mixer library is compiled. For more 
information on supported formats, see L<SDL::Mixer>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 play

SDL mixer environment. See L<Game::Asset::SDLSound::Manager> for more 
information.
